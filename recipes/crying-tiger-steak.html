    <h3>Melting Flavorful Steak</h3>
    <p>In Thailand, this dish is known as "Weeping Tiger Beef," or "Crying Tiger Beef." There are various stories to back up the name, one that the chiles in the sauce made a tiger weep; the other is that a tiger cried when a hunter killed and took away his cow.</p>
    <p>The recipe calls for sirloin or your favorite cut of beef which is marinated in a simple marinade, then quickly broiled to medium-rare and sliced up, leaving it extremely tender and full of flavor. It is then served with a delicious side sauce that simply pops with flavor (great with either salad or rice or both).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 to 3 good-quality sirloin steaks</li>

            <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
                        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground coriander </li>
                                <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place steaks in a shallow dish or resealable plastic bag. Pour marinade over the steaks. Turn the steaks several times to ensure they are covered with the marinade. Place in the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            While steak is marinating, make the accompanying sauce. Place all sauce ingredients together in a bowl and stir. Taste-test for a balance of spicy, sour, and sweet. Add more fish sauce if you'd like it saltier, or more sugar if too sour for your taste. Set aside.</li>
        <li>
            Broil steak approximately 3 to 5 minutes, then turn and boil another 3 to 5 minutes on the other side, depending on thickness. For this recipe, the steak should still be pink in the middle, medium-rare to medium. The same goes if you are grilling instead of broiling.</li>
        <li>
            Remove steak from oven and slice as thinly as you can. Place on a plate together with the accompanying sauce and a little fresh cilantro sprinkled over.</li>
    </ol>
