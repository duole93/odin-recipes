    <h3>Kill The Heat with this cool beverage</h3>
    <p>Unlike traditional lemonade made with lemon juice, Brazilian Lemonade uses fresh limes. It has a unique and refreshing taste from combining tangy limes with sweetened condensed milk, giving it a smooth, creamy texture and rich luscious flavor.</p>
    <p>Traditional Brazilian Lemonade is made by blending the entire lime, skin and all, then strained through a sieve. While all that lime zest does add a lot of flavor, I still find it to be bitter because of the pith..</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cold water</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar &dash;  The sugar helps to balance out the tanginess of the limes.</li>
            <li>Fresh lime juice &dash;  You&#39;ll need about 5 or 6 limes, depending on the size. Choose limes with smooth, thin skin &dash;  they tend to be the juiciest and have less chance of making the drink bitter.</li>
                <li>Lime zest &dash;  Adds more lime flavor to the lemonade.</li>
                    <li>Sweetened condensed milk &dash;  Adds the rich, creamy texture and flavor.</li>
                        <li>Ice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Scrub and wash the limes really well, then dry them. Zest one lime, then juice all of them. (Itâ€™s much easier to zest a lime before juicing it.)</li>
        <li> Stir together the cold water and sugar. Add the lime juice and zest, sugar-water, and sweetened condensed milk to a blender. Blend until smooth. Taste test and add more sugar if necessary.</li>
        <li>
            Pour in glasses over ice and garnish with a lime slice. Enjoy immediately.</li>
