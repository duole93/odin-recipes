    <h3>Burning Tender Chicken</h3>
    <p>This black pepper chicken is incredibly crispy, sticky, saucy and sweet, all my favorites when it comes to a great chicken dinner. Serve this over some rice and you’ve got yourself an easy dinner that your whole family will enjoy.</p>
    <p>This versatile recipe for black pepper chicken allows you to easily add or substitute other vegetables, such as broccoli or carrots. If you prefer pork or beef as your protein, go for that! When finished, this is best served over some cooked rice. It balances out the intense taste of all the great spices and Asian ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds chicken thighs (boneless and skinless cut into 1 inch cubes)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce (low sodium)</li>
                <li>6 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
                    <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
                        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
                            <li>2 large onions (chopped)</li>
                                <li>1 large red bell pepper (cut into 1 small ½ inch pieces)</li>
                                    <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium size bowl, combine the chicken pieces with the 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and minced garlic. Toss well. Sprinkle the cornstarch over the chicken and toss well.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine all the black pepper sauce ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetable oil to a wok or large skillet and heat over high heat. Add half the chicken to the wok and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer the chicken to a paper towel lined plate and repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
        <li> If there's no vegetable oil left in the skillet, add another tablespoon or so. Add the onion and peppers to the wok and cook for a minute. Add the chicken back to the wok and the prepared black pepper sauce. Toss until well combined. Drizzle the sesame oil over the chicken and stir.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately over rice.</li>
